We may see rapid growth over the next few years: Raamdeo Agrawal ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/we-may-see-rapid-growth-over-the-next-few-years-raamdeo-agrawal/articleshow/35831378.cms,Economic Times,"The central government has complete power with a clear mandate, but directives from the Centre have to be executed well at the state level. So, there are many things that are still not in Modiâs hands, saysRaamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director,Motilal Oswal Financial Servicesin an interview withNarendra NathanandSanket Dhanorkar.Are we looking at a multi-year bull run?I think the market has not yet priced in the full potential of theeconomy. For the first time, a true nationalist has come to power with a clear majority. There is a new-found energy across the nation. My sense is that the market has not yet understood the difference between 300-plus seats for NDA and 272-plus seats for BJP alone. Look at how the cabinet posts have been assigned â BJP allies have got limited posts and their negotiating power is diminished. Complete power is in the hands of the government. The political scenario is drastically different now. The economy is on the cusp of a historical positive change.It is the same vehicle, but the driver has changed. It is now being steered by a formula-one driver. So, the acceleration will be dramatic. It will become visible very quickly. Today we are growing at 4.5 per cent. Growth is likely to pick up pace rapidly in the next few years. A lot of things will happen in five years. It will be interesting to see the index level at that time. In the process, investors will make tons of money, because the market will discount that growth two years in advance. It will not wait for the fifth year. If all domestic and global factors align,marketswill go through the roof.Are there challenges to the fragile economic recovery?The current optimism is because a major variable â the shambolic political setup â has been corrected. There is no doubt that the new government has been fully empowered in this election; the mandate has been given to an extremely competent individual. Right now, everybody is bullish. But one must have tempered expectations. Finally, directives from the Centre have to be executed well at the state level. Otherwise it will be a waste. There are many things that are still not in Modiâs hands.A lot of other factors will also play a role. Good monsoons, favourable global environment, peaceful borders, etc., can change the entire scenario. But, only time will tell how many stars will align. So, a lot will depend on external factors. I am also keenly watching how the new government tacklesinflation, which is just a symptom of a much deeper problem somewhere else. The government has to address supply-side bottlenecks. A weak currency cannot make a strong country. That is why, inflation must go down. It will be the beginning of development,investments, and so on.The rally, so far, has been driven by hope. When will fundamentals take over?News headlines, and making money are two entirely different things. We should not get carried away by the headlines. The focus must be on who will actually make money. In most cases, it will be a company which is making money right now. Very rarely will a company that is broke today make money tomorrow, unless there is a complete change in business dynamics. Today, we do not have anything to go by. So, wherever there are anomalies in the economy, these will come back to normal levels. Right now, it is only about the promise of a better tomorrow. Some of these promises will have to take shape in the budget. What should be the first priority for the new government?India has to become much more business friendly. Finally, the country needs to create jobs for its rising young population. Who will create these jobs? More than the government, it is the businesses which will create jobs. Businesses can create jobs only if the business environment is friendly. They also cannot sustain growth without creating jobs. So, the government has to become business friendly. All hurdles should be removed. We need businesses to take more risks as it will result in more jobs.Will mid-capstockscontinue to perform better than large-caps for now?It really depends on the company. Mid-caps were lagging for quite some time; smallcaps even more. Eventually it has to converge. Large-caps are now looking highly priced. Investor appetite is limited at these levels. Most of the action is in the low-quality, low-priced segment. Smaller investors are clearly buying low-quality stuff, thinking that the price is low. But, even if it moves into high valuation territory, low quality will remain so. This is where the entire game ends. Sure, high quality stocks are expensive now. But that doesnâtmeanyou should have junk in your portfolio. If you find quality at a reasonable price, buy with modest expectations. Such names are few and far between. But, even if you get 3-4 such ideas over one year, you can make money. The challenge is to have patience and hold on to the investment. Filling with junk will be a disaster, but if it works, you get a multi-bagger. Investors in high quality may underperform in a rallying market, but will emerge better off over an entire cycle.Can we expect an earnings upgrade anytime soon?A 12-15 per cent earnings upgrade is definitely possible this year. As the economy recovers, sectors, such as cement, steel and automobiles, will pick up pace. Oil & gas can also contribute to earnings growth. Right now corporate profits are contributing around 4 per cent to theGDP, which is near the bottom of the band. At the peak of a cycle, this can go upto 7-8 per cent. Assuming 13-14 per cent nominal growth in GDP, it will double in rupee term to Rs 220 trillion in next six years. Now the question is whether the current profit of Rs 4 trillion will move up to Rs 8 trillion or Rs 16 trillion. If it maintains the current ratio, it will go to Rs 8 trillion. If it touches the upper end of the band, it will go to Rs 16 trillion. If this happens and the PE multiple remains the same, the market will go up four times. Profits will zoom the moment the economy moves from 5-6 per cent to 8-9 per cent growth. That is why there is a potential for the market to go up to the stratospheric levels from here.

Kaynes shares plunge 43% from October peak. Is a tactical rebound on the cards or more pain ahead? ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/kaynes-shares-plunge-43-from-october-peak-is-a-tactical-rebound-on-the-cards-or-more-pain-ahead/articleshow/125815992.cms,Economic Times,"Kaynes has plunged 43.5% from its October peak, with Friday’s 12.5% drop marking the steepest single-day decline. Momentum indicators remain bearish, signaling a risk of further slide toward the year’s low of Rs 3,825. However, being nearly 26% below its 200-day SMA suggests potential mean-reversion, with a contrarian recovery target at Rs 4,541 and downside below Rs 4,300.

Kaynes shares plunge 43% from October peak.

Momentum indicators remain bearish, signaling a risk of further slide toward the year’s low of Rs 3,825. However, being nearly 26% below its 200-day SMA suggests potential mean-reversion, with a contrarian recovery target at Rs 4,541 and downside below Rs 4,300.

The merger has also catapulted banks’loanmarket share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

On NoP basis, tier-2/3 markets contributed 75% of the business in FY24. Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency. HDFCLI is being very selective in tier-2/3 cities and is focusing only on top quartile of customers, based on various filters. Outlook HDFC Life (HDFCLI) has successfully worked its way to improve bancassurance as well as agency while focusing on SURU markets (semi-urban and rural) in FY24. This has led to 13% YoY growth in tier 2/3 locations while overall NoP has grown 11% YoY in FY24. However, high base and change in product mix (1,500bps higher ULIPs) have led to VNB declining 5% YoY in FY24. Basis strong product and distribution efforts on a base where higher ticket size segment has already halved to 6-7%, VNB growth should pick up ahead. Maintain BUY.

Revenue of INR 3,79,230 Mn (+1.3% YoY) was led by growth in the Communication (+4.2% YoY), Energy, Utilities, Resources & Services (+1.5% YoY), and Hi-Tech (+8.7% YoY) segments, although it fell short of our estimates by 3.2%. EBIT of INR 76,210 Mn (+2.4% YoY) fell behind our estimates by 6.1% due to higher-than-expected cost of sales; EBIT margins contracted by 94 bps YoY. PAT jumped by 30.5% YoY to INR 79,750 Mn due to a significant increase in other income; PAT margins improved by 465 bps YoY. In Q4FY24, the attrition rate stood at 12.6%, exceeding our base case estimate of 11.2% by 140 bps. We apply a reduced multiple of 21.0x on FY26E EPS to reflect top-line weakness and margin pressure.

India's global image better than before? Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s claim sparks online debate,https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/indias-global-image-better-than-before-zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-s-claim-sparks-online-debate-11766912159911.html,LiveMint,"Zoho's co-founder and former chief executive officer Sridhar Vembu recently said that India's image has “transformed” in the past decade. He credited Prime MinisterNarendra Modifor this shift and said it is also why the leader remains very popular among Indians living abroad. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu wrote that people who have lived in foreign countries “for a long period” can easily perceive this change. His made these remarks while responding to a Journalist who had shared a news article on the platform, arguing that India needs to understand the “limits of performative diplomacy” and how such efforts do not necessarily translate into tangible gains. He said, “Those of us who lived abroad for a long period (like I did, 30 years spent abroad) know just how much India's image abroad has transformed in the past 10 years. That is the real yardstick. We have to thank our Prime Minister for this and that is the reason his popularity is so high with the diaspora."" While Vembu’s post quickly gained traction, drawing thousands of views and multiple likes, not all netizens agreed with his assessment. Several users pushed back against his views, and questioned the basis of his claim. Some people also cited indicators such astourism trendsand passport strength to counter his argument. At the same time, others lauded his views and added their own perspectives. “Number of foreign tourists coming to a country is considered a reasonably good objective measure but that seems to be going in the opposite direction,” one user wrote. While Vembu countered by pointing to travel restrictions during Covid period, the user pushed back again by claiming that data shows tourists numbers have declined compared to pre-covid levels and the situation has not improved this year either. Another user noted that “If India's image has transformed so much, why does our passport still rank so low? In 2025, only 59 countries allow Indians in without a pre-approved visa…The ‘yardstick’ of a nation's rise is how much the world trusts its citizens to enter their borders and we are nowhere near the top yet.” Vembu responded by stating that a country'sGDP per capitais the ultimate factor determining the value of its passport, adding that India still ranks too low on that metric. “We as a Nation should be more concerned about the existing quality of life of an average citizen than what perception is carried by the global community and the Indian diaspora abroad,” a netizen noted.

On Saturday, top official of Shehbaz Sharif-led government admitted the profound impact of India's airstrikes at key military installations, contradicting its previous stance. Pakistan's Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on 27 December confirmed that India's precision air strikes caused damage to its Nur Khan Air Base located in Rawalpindi's Chakala during the year-end press briefing. He admitted that besides causing damage to military installation, thetargeted strikesinjured its military personnel posted there. ""They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,""ANIquoted Ishaq Dar as saying. In the early hours of May 7, the Indian Armed Forces launched air strikes as a part of Operation Sindoor in response to the 22 April Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives. He further elaborated on the sequence of events that followed and noted that Pakistan's civil and military leadership convened a meeting on the night of May 9 and ""authorised"" certain decisions in response to the evolving situation. Pakistan's Foreign Minister further disclosed the extent of damage and said that India ""made the mistake"" of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of 10 May. India's strategic andprecision strikesstruck 9 terrorist bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, including Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad, Syedna Bilal Camp in Muzaffarabad, Gulpur camp in Kotli, Barnala camp in Bhimber, Abbas camp in Kotli, Sarjal camp in Sialkot, Mehmoona Joya camp in Sialkot, Markaz Taiba camp in Muridke and Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur. Terrorist camps such as Lashkar-e-Taiba’s base in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad stronghold of Bahawalpur were the primary targets. Even though several satellite images confirmed the impact of India's strikes on Nur Khan Air Base, PAF Base Mushaf, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz Jacobabad, Pakistan refuted India's military action. Cross-border shelling continued for days until Pakistan's Director General of MilitaryOperations(DGMO) proposed a ceasefire to India's DGMO, which was ultimately accepted on 10 May. This is not the first time a top Pakistani official admitted to impact of India's strikes. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in May acknowledged that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Stay updated with the latestTrending,India,WorldandUSnews.
